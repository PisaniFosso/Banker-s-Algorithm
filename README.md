# Banker-s-Algorithm
This program will solve the banker’s algorithm. This algorithm stops deadlocks from happening by not allowing processes to start if they don’t have access to the resources necessary to finish. A process is allocated certain resources from the start, and there are other available resources. In order for the process to end, it has to have the maximum resources in each slot.
